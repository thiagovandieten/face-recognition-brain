# Description
This is a project that makes use ClarifiAI API to detect faces in images.
I'm creating this as part of a course by Zero to Mastery. I have however done a few things differently:
- I'm using Vite instead of Create React App
- I am rendering the squares by using the HTML Canvas API.
   
This projects requires a .env file with the following content:
```
VITE_CLARIFY_PAT_KEY="YOUR_CLARIFY_PAT_KEY"
```
